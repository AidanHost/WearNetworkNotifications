Network Notifications for Android Wear
======================================

This is the repository of the Wear Network Notifications Application.
It's a simply yet helpful app that will bring up notifications on connectivity
state and signal strength on an Android Wear device.

Just one glance to know if you are using Wifi, LTE, UMTS or if you are currently offline! 
See the signl strength in percent or dBm and the current network name! 
The information will automatically update every time the watch wakes 
up from ambient mode.

You even get a notification if your watch looses the Bluetooth connection 
to the phone. This makes any 'forgot my phone' app unnecessary!

The notifications can be customized through the companion app on the 
phone and it is also possible to only show the notification cards 
manually on the watch.

Installation / Usage
--------------------
The app project in this repository was generated by Android Studio.
Use the 'import project' function in Android Studio to import the repository
as new project.

The WearNetworkNotifications.apk file is also in this repository so that it can be used without 
building it yourself. But it won't be synched to the latest code base all the time.
Install the apk file on the handheld device and it will be synced to the
wearable device automatically (by the Android system).
